        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Euan and I am student based in Reading (UK). I am currently studying for my A Levels in computer science, maths and physics, while also developing software and expanding my knowledge of C#, python and development on the side.</p>
        <p>I have taught myself programming since around 2016, and would like to get into the software development industry once i have completed education. Currently I have worked on and released one project, Rower Suff, but I have plans for a few others in the near future. My school has also allowed me to acquire 2 MTA certifications in software development fundamentals and python programming, and in the near future I hope to achieve high grades in my A Levels which will allow me to go to the university of my choice.</p>

        <p>Please make sure to check out my projects and give any feedback! Thankyou!</p>

        <h2>My Languages And Extra Experience</h2>

        <p>C# and Python, with experience in Xamarin Android</p>
